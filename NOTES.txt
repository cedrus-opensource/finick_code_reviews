In some brand-new folder on your computer (outside of any folders currently under git control),
clone the finick_code_reviews git repository. check out the master branch.


In your *other* preexisting project (whichever one needs code reviews), do the following:

Somewhere in your other project's repo, create a subfolder called something like "code_reviews" (you choose the name)

Note: i will use MY_PROJ to denote the name of your project (which is probably also the name of your repo).

MY_PROJ does not have to match the name of repository. MY_PROJ is "what you call your work" that is under review.

in the "code_reviews" subfolder:

1. create a blank (empty) file named MY_PROJ_reviews.txt (extension txt)

2. check MY_PROJ_reviews.txt into git in your repo.

3. create a file named MY_PROJ_reviews.ini (extension ini)

4. for starting out, make MY_PROJ_reviews.ini contain the same content as:

https://github.com/cedrus-opensource/finick_code_reviews/blob/master/sample.reviews.ini

5. edit the values of your MY_PROJ_reviews.ini so that they make sense for your project.

6. check the MY_PROJ_reviews.ini into your git repo.

Note: if you cloned finick_code_reviews into a folder named finick_code_reviews (the git clone default behavior),
then you will have a folder "finick_code_reviews/finick/" that (among other things) contains start.py

7. in your code_reviews subfolder, create a symlink to "finick_code_reviews/finick/" (see WIN-NOTE below)

At this point, the following should be possible:

$ cd code_reviews
$ ./finick/start.py # you do not necessary want to run this yet. the path is here to explain file layout.

(if you did just run start.py, then you can run abort.py to abort the review session, if it started successfully)

WIN-NOTE: how to make a 'symlink' on windows...

you need to open a windows CMD.exe window that is running AS ADMINISTRATOR.
The command and its output look like this:

G:\path\to\yourproject\code_reviews>mklink /D finick g:\your\path\finick_code_reviews\finick
symbolic link created for finick <<===>> g:\your\path\finick_code_reviews\finick

(credits to http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18641864/git-bash-shell-fails-to-create-symbolic-links)


8. you should add code_reviews/finick to the .gitignore for your repo.

9. in the .gitignore, you also want to ignore these temp-files:
code_reviews/assignments*
code_reviews/todo*
code_reviews/*summarymail*
