## Finick, for code reviews

> 'finick' as in 'finicky, fussy, demanding' about code quality

### Goals

* simplicity
* minimal dependencies (depends on python and git. that's all for now.)
* code review history and comments are stored and versioned in your git repo
* track commit 'approval ratings' developer by developer, month by month

### Current Limitations:

* (main drawback) all developers must merge their work into a single review branch

If your team (presumably a small team) already 'shares' a single remote branch that they push to regularly, then finick will work for you.

See NOTES.txt for basic usage information.
